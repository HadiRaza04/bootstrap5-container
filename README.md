1) <b>.container</b> class provides a responsive fixed width container.

2) The <b>.container-fluid</b> class provides a full width container, spanning the entire width of the viewport.

3) By default, containers have left and right padding, with no top or bottom padding. Therefore, we often use spacing utilities, such as extra padding and margins to make them look even better. For example, <b>.pt-5</b> means <b>add a large top padding</b>.

4) You can also use the <b>.container-sm|md|lg|xl</b> classes to determine when the container should be responsive.
